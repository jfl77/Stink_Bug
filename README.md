<b>Jose Figueroa 0.26a.TIF Overview of the head of a brown marmorated stink bug; 4/11/2017; 15 kV, tilt angle: 0, WD: 55 mm, mag: 0.026 kx.</b> The head is the main focus of the image; however, other interesting features also become apparent. For instance the compound eyes are situated on opposite sides on the top third of the head, but next to them a pair of simple eyes or ocelli are also present. Different types of receptors also populate the top of the head, as well as the surface of the pronotum. This image was enhanced using Adobe Photoshop. The contrast was increased by 23 units, whereas the brightness was increased by 10.
